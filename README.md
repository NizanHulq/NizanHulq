👋 Hi there! I’m a Backend Developer and Fullstack Web Developer who loves clean code and meaningful systems and I love Data Sciences.

I’m currently working as a Backend Engineer using Java & Spring Boot, building scalable microservices for the travel industry. I enjoy solving real-world problems, especially those that involve system integration, API design, and backend optimization.

💡 Experienced in:
	•	Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Oracle, React Js, Tailwind CSS
	•	REST APIs, Microservices, GDS/NDC API integration
	•	Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI/CD

🔍 Currently exploring more about distributed systems and Analyze Data. 

When I’m not coding, I’m probably reading up on software architecture, debugging something stubborn, or just reorganizing my Notion 😄

📫 Feel free to connect or collaborate! I’m always open to working on exciting backend or web projects or learning something new.
